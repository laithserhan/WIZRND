# WIZRND

WIZRND, a pico-8 contribution to [#ProcJam 2016](https://itch.io/jam/procjam).

The main idea behind this project was to learn about developing for the PICO-8 platform -- although I have some programming experience, I've never made a game before. My goals were to simply make anything that was remotely playable, which actually didn't take that long.

Since I'm interested in procedural generation anyway and didn't have a lot of spare time to make a game in, contributing to #ProcJam was the perfect excuse for me to actually learn how PICO-8 works. Turns out, it's super fun and very straightforward.
